## TL;DR
- Membership-based voluntary basic income
- Voluntary. Members are free to leave at any time.
- Organised as local geographic lodges
- Monthly contributions of 10% of after-tax income. Contributions not tax-deductible. Benefits not taxable.
- Monthly benefits, the 1-year moving average of contributions
- Minor children of members are eligible for membership. 50% of benefits distributed; 50% held in trust. Lump-sum distribution at ages 18 and 25.
- 3 month incubation period for new members.
- Pure redistribution allows for 99%+ efficiency

## Core tenets

Purpose: Do one thing, and do it well: voluntary basic income, that is:

### Apolitical
The organisation will not involve itself in politics, e.g. it would not advocate for or against a governmental basic income. Support for basic income comes from all corners of the political spectrum: traditional progressives, libertarians and conservatives.

### Transparent
Everything from meeting minutes to full expense breakdowns would be made available to members. Operating documents, and any software would be made publicly available. The reality is that you can’t please everyone. If others want to organise differently, they shouldn’t need to reinvent the wheel. Call it the “standing on the shoulders” principle, if you will.

### Efficient
The aspiration is that every dollar that comes in will be dispersed as a basic income payment. Targeting 99%+ efficiency.
